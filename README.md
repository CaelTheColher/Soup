# Soup

For when one standard library is not enough.

## Getting Started

The recommended way to interact with this codebase is Visual Studio 2022.

There are no external dependencies, so all you have to do is run a batch build for the Soup project, then you can use it in your own projects by adding a compiler and linker include, respectively.

## Guides

For some ideas as to what you can do with Soup:

- [Programming a language](docs/Programming-a-language.md)
- [RSA](docs/RSA.md)

But there are obviously many more possibilites, just take a look around the codebase.

## License

You may use Soup for personal and commercial projects, but they must be open-source.
