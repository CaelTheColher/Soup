# Soup

The swiss army knife for C++ programmers with a focus on being compatible & bindable.

## Getting Started

The recommended way to interact with this codebase is Visual Studio 2022.

There are no external dependencies, so all you have to do is run a batch build for the Soup project, then you can use it in your own projects by adding a compiler and linker include, respectively.

If you want some ideas as to how start using Soup, check out [the docs](https://docs.soup.do/).

## Licence

You may use Soup for personal and commercial projects, but they must be open-source.

If you want to use Soup in a closed-source project, please contact licensing@calamity.gg about your use-case.
