# Soup

The everything library for C++ 17 and beyond with bindings for other languages.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're looking to use Soup from a language other than C++, have a look at [the bindings](https://github.com/calamity-inc/Soup/tree/senpai/bindings).

## Building

### Windows

Simply open up Soup.sln using Visual Studio 2022 and run a batch build for the Soup project to compile the static libraries, then you can use it in your own projects by adding a compiler and linker include, respectively.

### All Operating Systems

Soup can be built using our own build system, [Sun](https://github.com/calamity-inc/Sun). To include it in your own projects, we recommend the directory structure such that your own project and Soup share the same parent, then you can simply add the following to the .sun file for your project:

```
require ../Soup/soup include_dir=../Soup
```

This will make it so that you have to use `#include <soup/NAME.hpp>` in your code, which we recommend to avoid name clashes, similar to opting not to use `using namespace`. However, if you omit the `include_dir` part, you can use `#include <NAME.hpp>` directly.

### Bindings

To build Soup as a DLL/SO with C ABI exports, you can use `sun dynamic` (in the "soup" folder).

For WASM, it can be done via `php wasm.php` (in the root folder) or `sun wasm` (in the "soup" folder).
